# tcp_dweet
Let's dweet! A simple TCP/IP stack and a dweet.io demo application built on top of my PIC32 framework.

This simple TCP layer has been developed for establishing a connection with dweet.io in order to exchange two values between a PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit and a personal tablet over the internet. So, a dedicated Android APP has been developed.
